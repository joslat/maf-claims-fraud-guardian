13.2 MIT Dual-License (Per-File). Specific files MAY be dual-licensed under
     the MIT License in addition to the above. A file is dual-licensed ONLY if:

     repository, that copy is governed by MIT in that repository. This does not

     note linking back to the original file/commit in this repository.
